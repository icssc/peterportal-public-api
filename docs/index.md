## Features

Peterportal Public API offers two Web APIs to help you build your app!  

* [RESTful API](/docs/REST-API/start_here)  
* [GraphQL API](/docs/GraphQL-API/start_here)

## Where does the data come from?

We consolidate our data directly from official UCI sources such as: UCI Catalogue, UCI Public Records Office, and UCI Webreg. We routinely monitor for updates to ensure you get the most accurate information to serve on your application.

## Features

Peterportal Public API offers two Web APIs to help you build your app!  

* [RESTful API](/docs/REST-API/start_here)

## Where does the data come from?

We consolidate our data directly from official UCI sources such as: UCI Catalogue, UCI Public Records Office, and UCI Webreg. We routinely monitor for updates to ensure you get the most accurate information to serve on your application.

??? warning "Other Disclaimer"
    Although we consolidate our data directly from official UCI sources, this application is by all means, not an official UCI tool. We stride to keep our data as accurate as possible with the limited support we have from UCI. Please take that into consideration while using this API.

    There are no hard policies at the moment for utilizing this tool. However, please refrain from abusing the API by methods such as: sending excessive amount of requests in a small period of time or purposely looking to exploit the system. This tool is here mainly to assist developers in bringing their idea to life to benefit all UCI students. Please don't ruin it for others! 🙂

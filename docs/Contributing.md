## Documentation

**ü§î Documentation for the documentation. How do you contribute to the documentation?**

The documentation you see right now is created via [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). We use a specific extension called [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) which is what makes this site look pretty.

For Graph static documentation, we use [graphdoc](https://github.com/2fd/graphdoc). While it is a little buggy, it's the best tool I'm aware of that automatically generates static documentation. To update it, you will need two shells open.


!!! example "Shell 1"
    In the first shell, install dependencies and start the server.

    ``` bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    That's it, leave it alone. We need the server to be on because graphdoc will be using the live GraphQL endpoint

!!! example "Shell 2"

    In the next shell, run this command:

    === "Windows"

        ```
        graphdoc -e http://localhost:8080/graphql -o .\graphql\docs --force
        ```

    === "macOS/Linux"

        ```
        graphdoc -e http://localhost:8080/graphql -o graphql/docs --force
        ```

    This specifies the endpoint for GraphQL to use and forces an update on existing documentation files.

### Writing Documentation

**üìù Writing documentation is simple with MkDocs.**

1. Checkout the `docs` branch. All edits to documentation should be made within this branch
2. Make your changes to the markdown (`.md`) files within [`/docs`](https://github.com/icssc-projects/peterportal-public-api/tree/master/docs). You can add or delete files as you so choose.
3. Create a pull request to `master`. Once your pull request is merged with `master`, the documentation site will be automatically rebuilt.

??? info "How is the docs site updated?"
    All documentation site files are built within `/docs-site`.

    A Github Action, [`/.github/workflows/docs.yml`](https://github.com/icssc-projects/peterportal-public-api/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs.yml) automatically rebuilds the site on every push to master. `docs.yml` calls `mkdocs`, a python package, to build the site and automatically commit the new changes.

üêç Our documentation website is made through [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), a python package.

To setup `mkdocs-material`, see their [cool instructions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).


Configure documentation site settings in [`/mkdocs.yml`](https://github.com/icssc-projects/peterportal-public-api/blob/master/mkdocs.yml).
